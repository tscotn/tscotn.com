            <p>This semester I've been doing more freelance work, just a bit of data analytics here, some programming there...but this project united them all in one. A group of students in Mexico messaged me in need of an interface that could solve Linear Programming problems. They were taking a course in Python and wanted to have access to a project from start-to-finish that was also in Spanish. Programming bilingually was a bit of a new challenge, but an immensely rewarding one.</p>
            <p>The interface, which <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/tscotn/programacion_lineal'>can be downloaded from Github</a>, uses Tkinter to create the GUI, PuLP to solve the linear system given an objective function and a set of up to 10 constraints, and plots the solution using Matplotlib.</p>
